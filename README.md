# FPL API App

An experimental web application for pulling data from the <a href="https://fantasy.premierleague.com/">Fantasy Premier League (FPL)</a> API âš½ðŸ“ŠðŸ¤”

## Description

A project intended to further my experience in using API's and modern HTML, CSS and JavaScript techniques.

My goal with this application is to display certain data pulled from the Fantasy Premier League API. I will begin with standard pieces of data with the potential to expand this over time ðŸ¤“
